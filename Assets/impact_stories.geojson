In 2013, she became the very first recipient of a Watts of Love solar light. Growing up with eight siblings, her family faced financial challenges and never left the island.

Since receiving her solar light and financial literacy training in July 2023, she's been savvy with her money, avoiding spending Malawian Kwacha on batteries. Emery continues to make strategic investments in her land, witnessing the returns multiply. Remarkably, within just two months, she was selling sweet potatoes! Even on challenging days in the agriculture-driven village of Waiyatsa, Emery creatively repurposed dead corn, selling it as feed to buy soap.

Despite societal stigmas attached to making money at age 60, Felia felt empowered. It took a couple of weeks for her to grasp Watts of Love's financial literacy training, but the smile on her face when she pulled out her savings of 1000 kwacha from her Watts of Love box spoke volumes. Felia plans to use her newfound knowledge and savings to send her grandchildren to school.", "Image": "Stories/FELIA.png" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 34.63160907, -14.81811259 ] } },

He saved the money he had previously spent on kerosene and started buying and selling pigs. This led to financial stability and a new home for his family but also helped his fishing business. The solar light proved invaluable during low tide, helping Rambo spot glowing shrimp in the mangrove forest and enhancing the effectiveness of fishing lures, resulting in a greater catch. Inspired by this positive change, Rambo became a Watts of Love trainer, sharing his knowledge to empower others in nearby islands to overcome poverty through education and sustainable practices.", "Image": "Stories/RAMBO.png" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 121.0745679, 12.23623915 ] } },

She does not have hands or fingers. In 2016, when Nancy Economou and Kevin Kuster met Thuli and witnessed the daily challenges she and people like her face with even basic tasks like caring for themselves, they knew that our existing solar light would be of no use to the people living in the leper colony if they were unable to turn the lights on. Nancy and John Economou, along with Kevin, were determined to change this and to make Watts of Love’s solar lights usable for everyone. In November 2018, a Global Travel Team returned to the Khokana leper colony in Nepal and turned that vision into a reality!", "Image": "Stories/THULI.png" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 85.29430544, 27.64252259 ] } },

Before receiving a solar light in 2019, she weaved three small baskets per week and farmed for a living. After receiving her solar light, she could weave three larger baskets weekly, making more money. Within six months, she purchased two ducks and one chicken, and the chicken had five chicks. Still a farmer, she plans to breed ducks and chickens to sell and use that money to buy a pig for her family. Annette understands the value of her light and uses the low setting while cooking and the brighter setting as a headlamp when weaving at night. She is excited by the opportunity for her son to have brighter light while studying. We can't wait to visit Annette and see how her animals and son have grown.", "Image": "Stories/ANNETTE.png" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 29.62022993, -0.976054068 ] } }
